📍I am currently doing my research secondment at the University of Malaga!<br>

- Optics Institute "Daza de Valdés" (CSIC) <br>
In December of 2024, I started my PhD research journey on the topic _"Sensores fotónicos integrados en chip potenciados mediante inteligencia artificial y metamateriales nanoestructurados"_. The first two months I received training in "Introduction to Nano-Structured Devices in Waveguides" and spent time learning about the fundamentals of Integrated Photonics.<br>

- 📍 University of Malaga <br>
In February of 2025, I started my two-month research secondment at the University of Malaga at the Photonics & RF Research Lab where I am receiving theoretical training, learning how to use Fexen and Lumerical software for PIC design, as well as working in the lab and working with the optical setup for characterization of silicon photonic chips.<br>

## 💻Work Experience


**Master's student intern @ ICFO (_Feb 2024 - Jul 2024_)** <br>
I worked on my Master’s thesis project “Control of the propagation direction of Bound States in the continuum (BICs) in liquid crystal waveguides”.

**Co-founder & Embedded Automation Engineer @ Haptic Synaptic (_Oct 2021 - Oct 2023_)** <br>
I came up with an idea for a robotics project "Robot that makes friendship bracelets" that would inspire girls to get interested in technology (2018). I made a prototype, co-founded a start-up (2021), and received initial funding to build an educational robotics kit.
